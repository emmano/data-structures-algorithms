# data-structures-algorithms
Basic data structures and algorithms that follow Berkley CS61B

###What is the motivation?
Understanding Data Structures and algorithms is fundamental for every developer, specially, if you are self-taught like myslef. 

###What is the purpose of this repo?
While looking for a Data Structures and algorithms course I came across Prof. Jonathan Shewchuk's CS61B; his lectures are really great (big thanks to Berkley University for recording the lectures and making them available to the public). This repo implements some of the Data Structures and algorithms from that course while adding sufficient comments for others trying to learn.

###Disclamer!!!
These implementations should ***NOT*** be used in production code. They are no optimized and might contain errors. They are a means for me to practice and learn while trying to help others understand these concepts.
